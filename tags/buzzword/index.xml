      <description>I felt like continuing with the buzzwords run, and also learn something completely new. So today I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk a little bit about on how blockchains actually work, and write some psuedo-code.
What is a blockchain? From Wikipedia -
A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.  This wasn&amp;rsquo;t complicated at all.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk a bit about a cool buzzword in the crypto world - Homomorphic Encryption. What is it and how does it really work? And maybe more important, why do we want this?
Homomorphism Homomorphism is defined in a mathematical set such as the result of an operation is mirrored in another set by performing the same operation in that set.
$f:G\rightarrow H$ where $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$
Oh yes, I finally took the time to integrate LaTeX into Hugo.</description>
