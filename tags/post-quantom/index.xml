      <description>So, I recently treated myself with a Nintendo switch. Let&#39;s say computer time has been limited lately&amp;hellip;Saving Hyrule has been kind of my priority :)
I recently took a course called Kryptering 3 (advanced cryptography), which mostly is about post-quantom cryptography and the corresponding algorithms.
