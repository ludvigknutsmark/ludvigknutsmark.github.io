      <description>Meanwhile as I&#39;m stuck at trying to factorize polynomials in GF(2^128), see previous post, I decided to take a look at a new PAKE protocol I saw on twitter.
PAKE PAKE Protocols is a authenticated key exchange protocol. An example of a unauthenticated key exchange protocol is Diffie-Hellman. I&#39;ve written code on a very basic MITM-attack on Diffie-Hellman here.
In a PAKE protocol you authenticate through a password - and what makes it really great is that the password is also protected.</description>
